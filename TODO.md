- Debug the saving/restoring models workflow
- There is an issue in DataLoader.warp_data_to_3857 where we assume that the destination resolution is the same as the input resolution. I think this is "fine" if both src and dst CRS are in meters (dst CRS will always be meters as it is EPSG:3857), however the src CRS is not garunteed to be this. I need to figure out a way to convert degree resolution to meters here if necessary.
  - I've added a resolution key to datasets.json, need to pick this up in the back-end code.
- ServerModelsKeras with the demo models are not using the gpu
